<h1>About Arduino Project</h1>
This project contains the program which provides instructions to the Arduino racecar robot, outlining intended behavior.

<h2>Intended Environment and Conditions</h2>
This car robot is programmed assuming specific conditions are met including:
  <li>Arbitrary 'racetrack' path outlined by a thin, dark colored line.</li>
  <li>Mainly flat surface without obstructions in path.</li>

<h2>Path - Deviation and Correction</h2>
The robot will detect this path using two IR sensors identifying direction of deviations to perform autonomous course-correction.
